## üõ†Ô∏è In Progress / Next Up

### üîß Code Hygiene
- [ ] Run `npm i --package-lock-only` on Linux to fix audit error
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` to patch vulnerable packages
- [ ] Add `.env.example` or `.env.template` with relevant vars if needed
- [ ] Clean up logging noise and outdated Python warnings (e.g. `pkg_resources`)
- [ ] Patch the `tuple index out of range` bug in the PyInstaller flow

## üß™ Testing & Dev Environment
- [ ] Test mission loading with different `.miz` files in `data/Missions/`
- [ ] Validate UI interactivity (websockets, unit editing, session sync)
- [ ] Confirm frontend build path matches backend static file path
- [ ] Add a dev-friendly startup script (e.g. `start-dev.sh` or `.ps1`)

## üíª Frontend Refinement Ideas
- [ ] Replace `create-react-app` with Vite for faster dev builds *(optional)*
- [ ] Update design (map UI, colors, logo) to move away from UOAF branding
- [ ] Improve responsiveness / mobile support
- [ ] Add version info / environment tag (dev, prod) to frontend footer

## üì¶ Packaging & Deployment
- [ ] Build a working Windows `.exe` with PyInstaller using `camp.spec`
- [ ] Build Linux deployment flow (e.g. `poetry export > requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Consider Docker for cross-platform packaging

## üìÅ Repository Clean-Up
- [ ] Add `README.md` section explaining your fork and changes
- [ ] Set up GitHub project board or issues for tracking
- [ ] Confirm branch protection rules (set `main` as default)

## üß† Stretch Goals / Ideas
- [ ] Add pilot profiles for persistent data tracking (Loggers integration)
- [ ] Link this to your DCS-Arma Discord bot
- [ ] Add image previews for missions or map overlays in the frontend
- [ ] Add mission template selection or cloning in the UI

#### Description
Tauntaun Live Editor is browser based collaborative mission planning tool for DCS events.

#### Installation
#### Windows release
**Use develompent builds** ~~Executable is available under [releases](https://github.com/UOAF/project-tauntaun/releases).~~
    
Develompent builds are available under [actions](https://github.com/UOAF/project-tauntaun/actions/workflows/exe.yml)   
Click the top "Build exe" action and on the bottom of the page there should be a link to the dev build "tauntaun_live_editor_\<long number\>".    
_You need to be logged in to be able to see the download links._    
I recommend checking dev builds if something is missing(e.g. new weapon) or broken after a DCS patch.

#### Configuration
Configuration can be found at
```
Windows: C:/<User>/AppData/Roaming/tauntaun_live_editor/config.json
Linux: ~/.local/share/tauntaun-live-editor/config.json
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/tauntaun-live-editor/config.json
```
admin_password: password in SHA256 format, default is 1234

#### DCS Installation Detection
The application can automatically detect DCS installations on:
- **Windows**: Common Program Files locations and drive roots (C: through Z:)
- **Linux**: `/opt`, `/usr/local`, Steam installations, and user directories
- **macOS**: `/Applications`, user Applications, and Games directories

For development testing, you can run without a DCS installation by selecting "Development mode" during setup.
